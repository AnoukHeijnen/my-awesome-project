        By using living and breathing plants in a lumen print process, an aura is created in the image that represents that presentness. 
        I hope to bring a piece of that peace to you.''

    <p class="poem">As the world revolves, time and space alter perception
        of what is, sinking deeper into the normalcy of overexerting.
        Racing to an end that is no end at all, but simply a destination
        to what lies in its aftermath. Enlightenment of self often times
        goes neglected, and limitations suffocate the mind and soul.
        I learned that lesson through experience, my fire burning
        but dim in resolve. The world spinning around me, while
        my breath wishes a moment of solace in the chaos.
        Tread lightly walking beside ambition, for its weight can be heavy.
        The light inside blooms when presence of self becomes
        and peace manifests. I take deep breaths, aligning with tranquillity
        as stillness and my mind become one, 
        reuniting with parts of me lost in life’s pursuit.
        The fluid sound as my lungs inhale and exhale in a soothing 
        rhythm synchronizes my being. The breath of life is the aura of the soul,
        illuminating positivity and serenity in a world never ceasing.
        </p>
